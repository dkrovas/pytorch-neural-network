# pytorch-neural-network
Simple neural network designed to recognize images using pytorch and data from the Fashion-MNST database:https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist.
For this Neural Network AI, I installed and configured PyTorch within the development environment to facilitate machine learning tasks. With these tools, I developed and trained a basic neural network model using PyTorch, leveraging its powerful capabilities, emphasizing the importance of utilizing established machine learning frameworks like PyTorch to streamline development processes and ensure reliability.
